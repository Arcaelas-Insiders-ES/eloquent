# Welcome to Arcaelas Insiders!

Hello, if this is your first time reading the **[Arcaelas Insiders](https://github.com/arcaelas)**  **documentation**, let me tell you that you have found a good place to learn.  

**Our team** and *community* are happy to write and make methods simple to implement and understand, but I think you already know that.

Let's start with the basic implementation steps.
```bash
> npm i --save @arcaelas/collection
> yarn add --save @arcaelas/collection
```


## Implementation
```javascript
// Class Import Statement
import Collection from  '@arcaelas/Collection'

// Function import statement
import { Collection, Item } from  '@arcaelas/collection'

// EsModule
const Collection =  require('@arcaelas/collection')
```


# Collection

Today a wide variety of applications have **commands** to simplify processes and be intuitive, for this reason the **arcaelas** development team has implemented a library dedicated to the construction of **commands**.
